       "  'Background': 'Most commonly, secondary antibodies are generated by immunizing the host animal with a pooled population of immunoglobulins from the target species. The host antiserum is then purified through immunoaffinity chromatography to remove all host serum proteins, except the specific antibody of interest, and then modified with antibody fragmentation, label conjugation, etc., to generate highly specific detection reagents. Secondary antibodies can be conjugated to a large number of labels, including enzymes, biotin, fluorescent dyes/proteins, or gold particles. Here, the antibody provides the specificity to locate the protein of interest by recognizing a primary antibody that targets a particular antigen, and the label generates a detectable signal in the area of the formed immune complexes. The label of choice depends upon the experimental application. | <p>Immunolabeling with gold particles—also known as immunogold labeling, immunogold staining, or immunocolloidal gold technique—is a technique that uses colloidal gold as a marker. Colloidal gold is a negatively charged hydrophobic suspension, formed by electron dense metallic particles which have large specific surface area. It binds to macromolecules (IgG, Protein A or G) rapidly and stably by noncovalent electrostatic adsorption, preserving their natural biological activity. It has been used as a marker particle for the past 2 decades because of its simplicity of preparation, high resolution, good biocompatibility and tissue penetration and hence its suitability for ultrastructural studies and quantitative immunostaining. Due to variability in particle sizes and its high electron density, immunocolloidal gold technique is suitable for single or multi-label detection under immune-electron microscopes as well as light microscopes. It is used regularly with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to successfully identify the areas within cells and tissues where antigens are located. The high resolution of the technique allows to study structure–function relationships in the microenvironment of cells and tissues, and also explore protein distribution in cellular and extracellular components. Smaller gold particles are found to produce higher labeling intensity of the target antigen because of reduced steric hindrance. However, if steric hindrance does not make a significant difference, then larger gold particles could produce stronger color intensity under the light microscope. When smaller gold particles (1-5 nm) are used, the visualization is usually improved using silver-enhancement methods. Gold can also be attached to protein A or protein G instead of a secondary antibody, as these proteins bind mammalian IgG Fc regions in a non-specific way.\\r\\n</p>'},\n",

The host antiserum is then purified through immunoaffinity chromatography to remove all host serum proteins, except the specific antibody of interest.

Often 15-20 biotin moieties are coupled to a single IgG secondary antibody. Biotin binds avidin, streptavidin, or neutravidin with a high degree of affinity and specificity. In immunoassays avidin/streptavidin-biotin binding is used as a bridge between antibodies and reporters like enzymes (HRP, AP), fluorophores, chromophores, etc. Both avidin and streptavidin are tetrameric proteins capable of binding 4 biotin groups to each molecule of avidin or streptavidin, thus amplifying the signal intensity and detection sensitivity by increasing the concentration of reporters  at the antigenic site. Two main biotin-binding detection systems have been widely utilized: Avidin-Biotin Complex (ABC) and Labeled Streptavidin Biotin (LSAB) methods. In the ABC method free avidin (or streptavidin) is used as a bridge/link between the biotinylated antibody and а biotinylated reporter molecule, resulting in three reporter molecules coupled to the biotinylated antibody. The LSAB method employs a reporter-labeled streptavidin (avidin or neutravidin can alternatively be used) to detect the bound biotinylated-secondary antibody on the tissue section, blotting membrane or ELISA plate, improving the sensitivity of detection by 8-fold. The LSAB method is used when the avidin-biotin-enzyme complex in the ABC method becomes too large to penetrate the tissue.\\r\\n</p>'},\n",

       "  'Background': 'Most commonly, secondary antibodies are generated by immunizing the host animal with a pooled population of immunoglobulins from the target species. The host antiserum is then purified through immunoaffinity chromatography to remove all host serum proteins, except the specific antibody of interest, and then modified with antibody fragmentation, label conjugation, etc. to achieve highly specific reagents for molecular detection. Secondary antibodies can be conjugated to a large number of labels, including enzymes, biotin, and fluorescent dyes/proteins. Here, the antibody provides the specificity to locate the protein of interest by recognizing a primary antibody that targets a particular antigen, and the label generates a detectable signal in the area of the formed immune complexes. The label of choice depends upon the experimental application. \\r\\nBiotinylated antibodies are widely used in systems where signal amplification is desired. Often 15-20 biotin moieties are coupled to a single IgG secondary antibody. Biotin binds avidin, streptavidin, or neutravidin with a high degree of affinity and specificity. In immunoassays avidin/streptavidin-biotin binding is used as a bridge between antibodies and reporters like enzymes (HRP, AP), fluorophores, chromophores, etc. Both avidin and streptavidin are tetrameric proteins capable of binding 4 biotin groups to each molecule of avidin or streptavidin, thus amplifying the signal intensity and detection sensitivity by increasing the concentration of reporters  at the antigenic site. Two main biotin-binding detection systems have been widely utilized: Avidin-Biotin Complex (ABC) and Labeled Streptavidin Biotin (LSAB) methods. In the ABC method free avidin (or streptavidin) is used as a bridge/link between the biotinylated antibody and а biotinylated reporter molecule, resulting in three reporter molecules coupled to the biotinylated antibody. The LSAB method employs a reporter-labeled streptavidin (avidin or neutravidin can alternatively be used) to detect the bound biotinylated-secondary antibody on the tissue section, blotting membrane or ELISA plate, improving the sensitivity of detection by 8-fold. The LSAB method is used when the avidin-biotin-enzyme complex in the ABC method becomes too large to penetrate the tissue.\\r\\n'},\n",

The host antiserum is then purified through immunoaffinity chromatography to remove all host serum proteins, except the specific antibody of interest, and then modified with antibody fragmentation, label conjugation, etc., to generate highly specific detection reagents. Secondary antibodies can be conjugated to a large number of labels, including enzymes, biotin, fluorescent dyes/proteins, or gold particles. Here, the antibody provides the specificity to locate the protein of interest by recognizing a primary antibody that targets a particular antigen, and the label generates a detectable signal in the area of the formed immune complexes.

Cy3 is a cyanine dye with 3 carbon atoms/methine groups between two indolenine groups, NHS-ester, sulfonated at both indoles. It fluoresces greenish yellow with excitation max at ~550 nm and emission at ~570 nm. Cy3 can be detected by various fluorometers, imagers, and microscopes with standard filters for Tetramethylrhodamine (TRITC). Due to inherently high extinction coefficient, this dye is also easily detected by naked eye on gels, and in solution. Cy3 can be excited to about 50% of maximum with an argon laser (514 nm or 528 nm lines), or to about 75% of maximum with a helium/neon laser (543 nm line) or mercury lamp (546 nm line). For double labeling Cy3 has been typically used with Cy5, with fluorescein (using narrow band-pass emission filter to minimize Cy3 fluorescence in the FITC filter set), and also with  with Alexa Fluor 647 for multiple labeling when using a confocal microscope. Analog of Cy3 with greater photostability and higher fluorescence intensity suited for various biological applications such as imaging and flow cytometry, is Alexa Fluor 555 dye.\\r\\n</p>'},\n",

TRITC (tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate )is a bright orange-fluorescent dye. It is a derivative of rhodamine (a member of the fluorone dyes family) where a hydrogen atom on the bottom ring of the structure is replaced by isothiocyanate functional group (-N=C=S), making it more reactive to amine and sulfhydryl groups on proteins. The bond to antibodies is based on this reactive group. The excitation and emission wavelengths of TRITC are 550 nm and 573 nm respectively. The optimal degree of conjugation for least changes in the antibody affinity and maximal specific staining (fluorescence) is at a molecular ratio TRITC/Ab of approximately 2. Like most fluorochromes, TRITC is prone to photobleaching, i.e. losing fluorescing properties due to molecule structure degradation.  TRITC is inherently a quite stable dye, and thus exhibits less photobleaching than fluorescein, which is commonly used as a photobleaching standard.Loss of activity caused by photobleaching can be controlled by reducing the intensity or time-span of light exposure, by increasing the concentration of the fluorophore, or by employing more robust fluorophores that are less prone to bleaching (e.g., Alexa Fluors, Seta Fluors, or DyLight Fluors). Analogs of TRITC with greater photostability and higher fluorescence intensity tailored in various biological applications are Alexa 555 and DyLight 550.</p>'},\n",

Often 15-20 biotin moieties are coupled to a single IgG secondary antibody. Biotin binds avidin, streptavidin, or neutravidin with a high degree of affinity and specificity. In immunoassays avidin/streptavidin-biotin binding is used as a bridge between antibodies and reporters like enzymes (HRP, AP), fluorophores, chromophores, etc. Both avidin and streptavidin are tetrameric proteins capable of binding 4 biotin groups to each molecule of avidin or streptavidin, thus amplifying the signal intensity and detection sensitivity by increasing the concentration of reporters  at the antigenic site. Two main biotin-binding detection systems have been widely utilized: Avidin-Biotin Complex (ABC) and Labeled Streptavidin Biotin (LSAB) methods. In the ABC method free avidin (or streptavidin) is used as a bridge/link between the biotinylated antibody and а biotinylated reporter molecule, resulting in three reporter molecules coupled to the biotinylated antibody. The LSAB method employs a reporter-labeled streptavidin (avidin or neutravidin can alternatively be used) to detect the bound biotinylated-secondary antibody on the tissue section, blotting membrane or ELISA plate, improving the sensitivity of detection by 8-fold. The LSAB method is used when the avidin-biotin-enzyme complex in the ABC method becomes too large to penetrate the tissue.\\r\\n</p>'},\n",

       "  'Background': 'Most commonly, secondary antibodies are generated by immunizing the host animal with a pooled population of immunoglobulins from the target species. The host antiserum is then purified through immunoaffinity chromatography to remove all host serum proteins, except the specific antibody of interest. Purified secondary antibodies are further solid phase adsorbed with other species serum proteins to minimize cross-reactivity in tissue or cell preparations, and are then modified with antibody fragmentation, label conjugation, etc., to generate highly specific reagents. Secondary antibodies can be conjugated to a large number of labels, including enzymes, biotin, and fluorescent dyes/proteins. Here, the antibody provides the specificity to locate the protein of interest, and the label generates a detectable signal. The label of choice depends upon the experimental application. | <p>Biotinylated antibodies are widely used in systems where signal amplification is desired. Often 15-20 biotin moieties are coupled to a single IgG secondary antibody. Biotin binds avidin, streptavidin, or neutravidin with a high degree of affinity and specificity. In immunoassays avidin/streptavidin-biotin binding is used as a bridge between antibodies and reporters like enzymes (HRP, AP), fluorophores, chromophores, etc. Both avidin and streptavidin are tetrameric proteins capable of binding 4 biotin groups to each molecule of avidin or streptavidin, thus amplifying the signal intensity and detection sensitivity by increasing the concentration of reporters  at the antigenic site. Two main biotin-binding detection systems have been widely utilized: Avidin-Biotin Complex (ABC) and Labeled Streptavidin Biotin (LSAB) methods. In the ABC method free avidin (or streptavidin) is used as a bridge/link between the biotinylated antibody and а biotinylated reporter molecule, resulting in three reporter molecules coupled to the biotinylated antibody. The LSAB method employs a reporter-labeled streptavidin (avidin or neutravidin can alternatively be used) to detect the bound biotinylated-secondary antibody on the tissue section, blotting membrane or ELISA plate, improving the sensitivity of detection by 8-fold. The LSAB method is used when the avidin-biotin-enzyme complex in the ABC method becomes too large to penetrate the tissue.\\r\\n</p>'},\n",

Here, the antibody provides the specificity to locate the protein of interest by recognizing a primary antibody that targets a particular antigen, and the label generates a detectable signal in the area of the formed immune complexes. The label of choice depends upon the experimental application. | <p>Fluorescent reporters widely used in biological research are of two types: organic compounds with a low molecular weight (0.2-1 kDa) typically containing numerous aromatic groups, or plane or cyclic moieties with π bonds (e.g.FITC, TRITC, Alexa Fluor Dyes, DyLight Fluors), and biological fluorophores (e.g.green fluorescent protein (GFP), R-Phycoerythrin). Cy3 is a cyanine dye with 3 carbon atoms/methine groups between two indolenine groups, NHS-ester, sulfonated at both indoles. It fluoresces greenish yellow with excitation max at ~550 nm and emission at ~570 nm. Cy3 can be detected by various fluorometers, imagers, and microscopes with standard filters for Tetramethylrhodamine (TRITC). Due to inherently high extinction coefficient, this dye is also easily detected by naked eye on gels, and in solution. Cy3 can be excited to about 50% of maximum with an argon laser (514 nm or 528 nm lines), or to about 75% of maximum with a helium/neon laser (543 nm line) or mercury lamp (546 nm line). For double labeling Cy3 has been typically used with Cy5, with fluorescein (using narrow band-pass emission filter to minimize Cy3 fluorescence in the FITC filter set), and also with  with Alexa Fluor 647 for multiple labeling when using a confocal microscope. Analog of Cy3 with greater photostability and higher fluorescence intensity suited for various biological applications such as imaging and flow cytometry, is Alexa Fluor 555 dye.\\r\\n</p>'},\n",

       "  'Background': 'Most commonly, secondary antibodies are generated by immunizing the host animal with a pooled population of immunoglobulins from the target species. The host antiserum is then purified through immunoaffinity chromatography to remove all host serum proteins, except the specific antibody of interest, and then modified with antibody fragmentation, label conjugation, etc., to generate highly specific detection reagents. Secondary antibodies can be conjugated to a large number of labels, including enzymes, biotin, fluorescent dyes/proteins, or gold particles. Here, the antibody provides the specificity to locate the protein of interest by recognizing a primary antibody that targets a particular antigen, and the label generates a detectable signal in the area of the formed immune complexes. The label of choice depends upon the experimental application. | <p>Fluorescent reporters widely used in biological research are of two types: organic compounds with a low molecular weight (0.2-1 kDa) typically containing numerous aromatic groups, or plane or cyclic moieties with π bonds (e.g.FITC, TRITC, Alexa Fluor Dyes, DyLight Fluors), and biological fluorophores (e.g.green fluorescent protein (GFP), R-Phycoerythrin). TRITC (tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate )is a bright orange-fluorescent dye. It is a derivative of rhodamine (a member of the fluorone dyes family) where a hydrogen atom on the bottom ring of the structure is replaced by isothiocyanate functional group (-N=C=S), making it more reactive to amine and sulfhydryl groups on proteins. The bond to antibodies is based on this reactive group. The excitation and emission wavelengths of TRITC are 550 nm and 573 nm respectively. The optimal degree of conjugation for least changes in the antibody affinity and maximal specific staining (fluorescence) is at a molecular ratio TRITC/Ab of approximately 2. Like most fluorochromes, TRITC is prone to photobleaching, i.e. losing fluorescing properties due to molecule structure degradation.  TRITC is inherently a quite stable dye, and thus exhibits less photobleaching than fluorescein, which is commonly used as a photobleaching standard.Loss of activity caused by photobleaching can be controlled by reducing the intensity or time-span of light exposure, by increasing the concentration of the fluorophore, or by employing more robust fluorophores that are less prone to bleaching (e.g., Alexa Fluors, Seta Fluors, or DyLight Fluors). Analogs of TRITC with greater photostability and higher fluorescence intensity tailored in various biological applications are Alexa 555 and DyLight 550.</p>'},\n",

Often 15-20 biotin moieties are coupled to a single IgG secondary antibody. Biotin binds avidin, streptavidin, or neutravidin with a high degree of affinity and specificity. In immunoassays avidin/streptavidin-biotin binding is used as a bridge between antibodies and reporters like enzymes (HRP, AP), fluorophores, chromophores, etc. Both avidin and streptavidin are tetrameric proteins capable of binding 4 biotin groups to each molecule of avidin or streptavidin, thus amplifying the signal intensity and detection sensitivity by increasing the concentration of reporters  at the antigenic site. Two main biotin-binding detection systems have been widely utilized: Avidin-Biotin Complex (ABC) and Labeled Streptavidin Biotin (LSAB) methods. In the ABC method free avidin (or streptavidin) is used as a bridge/link between the biotinylated antibody and а biotinylated reporter molecule, resulting in three reporter molecules coupled to the biotinylated antibody. The LSAB method employs a reporter-labeled streptavidin (avidin or neutravidin can alternatively be used) to detect the bound biotinylated-secondary antibody on the tissue section, blotting membrane or ELISA plate, improving the sensitivity of detection by 8-fold. The LSAB method is used when the avidin-biotin-enzyme complex in the ABC method becomes too large to penetrate the tissue.\\r\\n</p>'},\n",

The host antiserum is then purified through immunoaffinity chromatography to remove all host serum proteins, except the specific antibody of interest.

Often 15-20 biotin moieties are coupled to a single IgG secondary antibody. Biotin binds avidin, streptavidin, or neutravidin with a high degree of affinity and specificity. In immunoassays avidin/streptavidin-biotin binding is used as a bridge between antibodies and reporters like enzymes (HRP, AP), fluorophores, chromophores, etc. Both avidin and streptavidin are tetrameric proteins capable of binding 4 biotin groups to each molecule of avidin or streptavidin, thus amplifying the signal intensity and detection sensitivity by increasing the concentration of reporters  at the antigenic site. Two main biotin-binding detection systems have been widely utilized: Avidin-Biotin Complex (ABC) and Labeled Streptavidin Biotin (LSAB) methods. In the ABC method free avidin (or streptavidin) is used as a bridge/link between the biotinylated antibody and а biotinylated reporter molecule, resulting in three reporter molecules coupled to the biotinylated antibody. The LSAB method employs a reporter-labeled streptavidin (avidin or neutravidin can alternatively be used) to detect the bound biotinylated-secondary antibody on the tissue section, blotting membrane or ELISA plate, improving the sensitivity of detection by 8-fold. The LSAB method is used when the avidin-biotin-enzyme complex in the ABC method becomes too large to penetrate the tissue.\\r\\n</p>'},\n",

       "  'Background': 'Most commonly, secondary antibodies are generated by immunizing the host animal with a pooled population of immunoglobulins from the target species. The host antiserum is then purified through immunoaffinity chromatography to remove all host serum proteins, except the specific antibody of interest, and then modified with antibody fragmentation, label conjugation, etc., to generate highly specific detection reagents. Secondary antibodies can be conjugated to a large number of labels, including enzymes, biotin, fluorescent dyes/proteins, or gold particles. Here, the antibody provides the specificity to locate the protein of interest by recognizing a primary antibody that targets a particular antigen, and the label generates a detectable signal in the area of the formed immune complexes. The label of choice depends upon the experimental application. | <p>Fluorescent reporters widely used in biological research are of two types: organic compounds with a low molecular weight (0.2-1 kDa) typically containing numerous aromatic groups, or plane or cyclic moieties with π bonds (e.g.FITC, TRITC, Alexa Fluor Dyes, DyLight Fluors), and biological fluorophores (e.g.green fluorescent protein (GFP), R-Phycoerythrin). TRITC (tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate )is a bright orange-fluorescent dye. It is a derivative of rhodamine (a member of the fluorone dyes family) where a hydrogen atom on the bottom ring of the structure is replaced by isothiocyanate functional group (-N=C=S), making it more reactive to amine and sulfhydryl groups on proteins. The bond to antibodies is based on this reactive group. The excitation and emission wavelengths of TRITC are 550 nm and 573 nm respectively. The optimal degree of conjugation for least changes in the antibody affinity and maximal specific staining (fluorescence) is at a molecular ratio TRITC/Ab of approximately 2. Like most fluorochromes, TRITC is prone to photobleaching, i.e. losing fluorescing properties due to molecule structure degradation.  TRITC is inherently a quite stable dye, and thus exhibits less photobleaching than fluorescein, which is commonly used as a photobleaching standard.Loss of activity caused by photobleaching can be controlled by reducing the intensity or time-span of light exposure, by increasing the concentration of the fluorophore, or by employing more robust fluorophores that are less prone to bleaching (e.g., Alexa Fluors, Seta Fluors, or DyLight Fluors). Analogs of TRITC with greater photostability and higher fluorescence intensity tailored in various biological applications are Alexa 555 and DyLight 550.</p>'},\n",

CXC chemokine ligand 13(CXCL13), CC chemokine ligand 21(CCL21), and CCL19 are constitutively expressed in secondary lymphoid organs, where they control the placement of lymphocytes and dendritic cells.

       "  'Background': '\\r\\nChemiluminescence refers to the light emitted by a chemical reaction and chemiluminescent systems have emerged as the best all-around technique for the revelation step of blotting-based analyses. Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) Conjugated Secondary Antibodies are the most popular antibody conjugates and are widely used to obtain chemiluminescent results in western and other immunoblotting, ELISA, and immunochemistry. In the chemiluminescence reaction Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) catalyzes the oxidation of cyclic diacylhydrazides, such as luminol, or acridine derivatives in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) acting as activator or oxidizing agent. Immediately following the oxidation, the luminol is in an excited state (intermediate reaction product), which decays to the ground state by emitting light. Strong up to 1000-fold enhancement of the light emission is produced by enhancers, such as phenolic compounds, making the light emission much prolonged and very intense. This allows detection of protein at a level of 1-10 pg. \\n\\r\\n\\tEnhanced Chemiluminescent (ECL) Reagent Kit is an immunodetection system that utilizes horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, anti-goat, or anti-rat secondary antibodies for ECL western blot detection of proteins. Proteins from various samples such as cell lysates are first separated within an acrylamide gel under adapted electric current (electrophoresis) and then transferred onto a PVDF or nitrocellulose membrane (transfer). The membrane containing the proteins is then incubated with specific primary antibodies which bind to their specific target(s) (capture) and subsequently with Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies which bind to the primary antibodies (detection). Addition of chemiluminescent reagents (HRP luminol-based substrate, enhancer and activator) results in a chemiluminescent signal that can be captured using photographic or other imaging methods (revelation). The peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of luminol produces a glow-type light emission at 428 nm. The intensity of light output is proportional to peroxidase activity and is a measure of the number of enzyme molecules reacting and thus of the amount of target antigen.\\n'},\n",

NHS-LC-Biotin contains a biotin moiety, an elongated alkyl chain spacer arm (~22 Å) and an amine-reactive active NHS ester. NHS-LC-Biotin reacts efficiently and irreversibly with a wide range of compounds containing primary amine (-NH2) residues, including proteins, antibodies and other biomolecules (e.g. lysines on the surface of proteins). The spacer arm reduces steric hindrance when binding several biotinylated molecules to one avidin complex. This biotinylation compound is membrane permeable (contains no charged groups), making it well suited for intracellular protein labeling. ',\n",

       "  'Background': '\\r\\nChemiluminescence refers to the light emitted by a chemical reaction and chemiluminescent systems have emerged as the best all-around technique for the revelation step of blotting-based analyses. Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) Conjugated Secondary Antibodies are the most popular antibody conjugates and are widely used to obtain chemiluminescent results in western and other immunoblotting, ELISA, and immunochemistry. In the chemiluminescence reaction Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) catalyzes the oxidation of cyclic diacylhydrazides, such as luminol, or acridine derivatives in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) acting as activator or oxidizing agent. Immediately following the oxidation, the luminol is in an excited state (intermediate reaction product), which decays to the ground state by emitting light. Strong up to 1000-fold enhancement of the light emission is produced by enhancers, such as phenolic compounds, making the light emission much prolonged and very intense. This allows detection of protein at a level of 1-10 pg. \\n\\r\\n  Enhanced Chemiluminescent (ECL) Reagent Kit is an immunodetection system that utilizes horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, anti-goat, or anti-rat secondary antibodies for ECL western blot detection of proteins. Proteins from various samples such as cell lysates are first separated within an acrylamide gel under adapted electric current (electrophoresis) and then transferred onto a PVDF or nitrocellulose membrane (transfer). The membrane containing the proteins is then incubated with specific primary antibodies which bind to their specific target(s) (capture) and subsequently with Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies which bind to the primary antibodies (detection). Addition of chemiluminescent reagents (HRP luminol-based substrate, enhancer and activator) results in a chemiluminescent signal that can be captured using photographic or other imaging methods (revelation). The peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of luminol produces a glow-type light emission at 428 nm. The intensity of light output is proportional to peroxidase activity and is a measure of the number of enzyme molecules reacting and thus of the amount of target antigen.\\n'},\n",

Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) Conjugated Secondary Antibodies are the most popular antibody conjugates and are widely used to obtain chemiluminescent results in western and other immunoblotting, ELISA, and immunochemistry. In the chemiluminescence reaction Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) catalyzes the oxidation of cyclic diacylhydrazides, such as luminol, or acridine derivatives in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) acting as activator or oxidizing agent. Immediately following the oxidation, the luminol is in an excited state (intermediate reaction product), which decays to the ground state by emitting light. Strong up to 1000-fold enhancement of the light emission is produced by enhancers, such as phenolic compounds, making the light emission much prolonged and very intense. This allows detection of protein at a level of 1-10 pg. \\n\\r\\n  Enhanced Chemiluminescent (ECL) Reagent Kit is an immunodetection system that utilizes horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, anti-goat, or anti-rat secondary antibodies for ECL western blot detection of proteins. Proteins from various samples such as cell lysates are first separated within an acrylamide gel under adapted electric current (electrophoresis) and then transferred onto a PVDF or nitrocellulose membrane (transfer). The membrane containing the proteins is then incubated with specific primary antibodies which bind to their specific target(s) (capture) and subsequently with Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies which bind to the primary antibodies (detection). Addition of chemiluminescent reagents (HRP luminol-based substrate, enhancer and activator) results in a chemiluminescent signal that can be captured using photographic or other imaging methods (revelation). The peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of luminol produces a glow-type light emission at 428 nm. The intensity of light output is proportional to peroxidase activity and is a measure of the number of enzyme molecules reacting and thus of the amount of target antigen.\\n'},\n",
